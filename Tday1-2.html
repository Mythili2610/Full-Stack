        <h3>SUN</h3>
        <p>The sun is a star, specifically a G-type main-sequence star, located at the center of our solar system. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma that generates energy through nuclear fusion, radiating this energy as visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation. The sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping planets and other objects in orbit</p>

        <h3>MERCURY</h3>
        <p>Mercury is both a chemical element and the smallest planet in our solar system. As a chemical element, it's a heavy, silvery metal that is liquid at room temperature, symbolized by Hg and with atomic number 80. It's also known as quicksilver and is toxic to living organisms. As a planet, Mercury is the closest to the Sun and completes an orbit every 88 Earth days. </p>

    <div id="venus">
        <h3>VENUS</h3>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is known as Earth's "twin" or "sister" planet due to its similar size and structure. However, Venus has a thick, dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead</p>

    <div id="earth">
        <h3>EARTH</h3>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined.</p>
